# Multiple-Applications-and-Login
I developed a Visual Basic project featuring a robust login system and personalized user pages. The user interface offered access to five distinct applications: Tic-Tac-Toe (X and O game), a Calculator, a Weather app, a Slot machine simulator, and integrated Google Maps functionality. This project showcased my proficiency in creating a versatile application with a wide range of features, enhancing user interaction and engagement.
